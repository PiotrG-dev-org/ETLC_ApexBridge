# ETLC_ApexBridge

## Synopsis

Design Pattern: Lightning Components Communicating With Apex.

## Motivation

Lightning Components is a pretty cool technology that allows you to write SPA architecture applications where most logic happens on the client, but you still need to talk to the back end for other operations like reading and writing data to your custom and standard objects, sending emails, talking to external web servers, etc. Although communicating with a server is important task, there is not a clean reusable way of handling this communication.
